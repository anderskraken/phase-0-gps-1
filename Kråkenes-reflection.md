# Release 7: Reflect

## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I think I mostly got the concepts, but I struggled with the correct nomenclature and remembering the exact workflow. Also wanted to learn more about writing commit messages.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* That git tracks changes, not files
* The correct nomenclature for what git does
* Writing good commit messages

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Asked the guide about shortcuts and tips

## What still confuses you about Git?

Do I have to create and check-out a new branch before I make changes, or will it also work if I am in the master branch, make a change, and then create and hheck-out the new branch?

Or is this not considered good git workflow since the change will the remain somewhere (in the head?) in the master branch?

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great, even though the other pair did not show up.
